# PHP2550-Project1-EDA

### Background

The implications of weather conditions on athletics performance in endurance exercises such as marathons have raised considerable attention over the past few years. It was hypothesized by researchers that participantsâ€™ performance would be degraded as they aged, or with warmer conditions, or by sex. Among all weather-related factors, temperature (i.e., heat or cold), relative humidity (i.e., dry or humid), wind speed, solar radiation, and air quality are considered to have the largest potential effect. Exploration needed to be done to validate these statements and to determine the relationship between weather conditions and the performance.

### Methods

This report investigates the relationship between age, sex, and environmental conditions on marathon performance using figures, summary tables, and a quadratic linear modeling approach. It examines the impact of environmental factors, including Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), relative humidity, solar radiation, wind, and average air quality index (AQI), on performance, while also exploring whether these effects vary across different age groups and genders. By incorporating both the linear and quadratic terms of age (Age and $\text{Age}^2$), the model captures the non-linear relationship observed between age and marathon performance. The analysis aims to identify the weather conditions with the greatest influence on marathon performance and provide insights into how these effects interact with demographic factors.

### Results

This report's exploratory data analysis revealed that there was a U-shape, non-linear relationship between marathon performance and age for both men and women. This suggests that the performance would first increase, reach a peak, and then decrease after some point of age. On average, the optimal performance was observed in women age 28, and men age 30. Weather conditions tended to have a larger impact on the elderly compared to the younger, relationships differ by different weather-related variables.

## Files
### Data PreProcessing
`Data_PreProcessing.R`: Contains the preprocessing steps necessary for exploratory data analysis. Specifically, this script merged the air quality variable to the raw data and created a categorical variable for age `age_grp` using the 24, 39, 54, and 69 cut-offs. 

### Report
`PHP2550_Project1.Rmd`: The Rmarkdown version of the Exploratory Data Analysis report, which includes both written text interpretations and raw code used in the analysis. 

`PHP2550_Project1.pdf`: The PDF version of the Exploratory Data Analysis report, which includes both written text interpretations and a Code Appendix with the raw code used in the analysis. 

### Visuals
Included tables and Figures included in the report.
