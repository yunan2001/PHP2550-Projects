# Abstract

Cluster randomized trials are widely used in public health and clinical research to evaluate treatment effects, requiring careful design to balance the number of clusters, the number of measurements per cluster, and associated costs under budget constraints. This project employs simulation studies guided by the ADEMP framework to optimize resource allocation strategies for minimizing the variance of treatment effect estimates ($\hat{\beta}$). Using Normal and Poisson data-generating mechanisms, we evaluate the impacts of relative cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$), variance components ($\sigma^2$, $\gamma^2$), and treatment effect sizes on the precision and power of $\hat{\beta}$. Results demonstrate that increasing the number of clusters reduces variance but exhibits diminishing returns, while lower cost ratios allocate more resources to within-cluster measurements, improving precision. However, distributional assumptions influence these dynamics, with Poisson outcomes showing greater sensitivity to between-cluster variability. These findings underscore the importance of tailored resource allocation strategies in designing cost-efficient and statistically robust cluster randomized trials.

# Introducation

Cluster randomized trials are widely used in public health and clinical
research, where clusters of units are randomized to either control or
treatment groups to estimate treatment effects. For example, in a study
evaluating the effectiveness of a new hand hygiene protocol, hospitals
were randomized to either implement the protocol or continue standard
practices. Within each hospital, individual patient outcomes, such as
rates of hospital-acquired infections, were measured to assess the
impact of the intervention (Clancy et al., 2020). In another study,
individuals were treated as clusters, and repeated measurements, such as
daily blood glucose levels, were collected to assess the effect of a
dietary intervention on long-term glycemic control (Karimian et al.,
2023).

In our study, we consider clusters as individuals and the number of
observations per cluster as repeated measurements of these individuals.
Designing an efficient cluster randomized trial requires balancing the
number of clusters, the number of repeated measurements per cluster, and
the associated costs while maximizing statistical precision under a
fixed budget. A critical design challenge for cluster randomized trials
lies in allocating a fixed budget to maximize the precision of treatment
effect estimates. This challenge is further complicated by uncertainties
in intracluster correlation coefficients, which measure within-cluster
similarity. While independent observations are generally preferred for
statistical power, budget constraints often necessitate strategic
trade-offs between the number of clusters and the number of measurements
per cluster. In some cases, obtaining additional measurements within the
same cluster or subject can be significantly less expensive than
recruiting new clusters or subjects. For example, with a fixed budget,
sampling a smaller number of subjects with repeated measurements may
yield comparable or even improved precision for estimating treatment
effects by reducing residual variance.

This project, in collaboration with Dr. Zhijin Wu from the Biostatistics
Department, aims to develop a simulation study to identify optimal
cluster randomized trial designs under budgetary constraints. Using
simulation studies guided by the aim, data structure, estimand, methods,
and performance (ADEMP) framework, the study systematically explores
trade-offs between cluster-level and within-cluster observations under
varying cost structures and statistical assumptions. By evaluating
resource allocation strategies, the project provides practical
recommendations for designing cost-effective and statistically robust
cluster randomized trials that maximize the precision of treatment
effect estimates. Additionally, extending the simulations to outcomes
modeled with a Poisson distribution will offer insights into how
hierarchical modeling assumptions impact design recommendations,
contributing to advancing the methodology for resource-efficient
experimental designs in cluster randomized trials.

# Method

To achieve the aims of the project, we are employing the ADEMP
framework, a structured approach for designing and reporting simulation
studies, ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and thorough evaluation of
statistical methods. The framework includes five key elements: Aims,
which specify the study's objectives, such as evaluating bias,
precision, or power; Data-generating mechanisms, which define how data
are simulated, including underlying models and parameter values;
Estimands, identifying the quantities or parameters of interest being
assessed; Methods, describing the statistical techniques or models
applied to estimate these quantities; and Performance measures, which
evaluate the methods' effectiveness using metrics like bias, mean
squared error, variance or power. This systematic approach guides the
design and analysis of simulation studies to achieve robust and
meaningful insights. By adopting this structured approach, the framework
ensures methodological rigor, enhances reproducibility, and provides a
comprehensive evaluation of statistical methods within the context of
simulation-based research.

## Simulation Framework

The simulation study adheres to the ADEMP framework to evaluate optimal designs for cluster randomized trials under budget
constraints.

**Aims:**

To evaluate the impacts (1) of the optimal allocation of a fixed budget across the number of clusters ($G$) and the number of measurements per cluster ($R$) in a cluster randomized trial, focusing on minimizing the variance of the estimated treatment effect ($\beta$) while balancing trade-offs between within-cluster and between-cluster variability; (2) of underlying data-generating parameters, such as $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$ for Normal outcomes and $\beta$ and $\gamma^2$ for Poisson outcomes, as well as relative cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$), on the precision and power of the treatment effect estimate; and (3) of differences in performance under Normal and Poisson data-generating mechanisms, investigating how distributional assumptions influence the results and optimal design strategies.


**Data-Generating Mechanisms:** 

- Normal Outcomes: For observation $j = 1, \cdots, R$ within cluster $i = 1, \cdots, G$, generate the data under the hierarchical structure:
\begin{align*}
        \mu_{i0} &= \alpha + \beta X_i \quad \text{(fixed effects, where $X_i = 0$ for control and $X_i = 1$ for treatment)}, \\
        \mu_i \mid \epsilon_i &= \mu_{i0} + \epsilon_i, \quad \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \gamma^2), \\
        Y_{ij} \mid \mu_i &= \mu_i + e_{ij}, \quad e_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2).
    \end{align*} 
    
-   Poisson Outcomes: For observation $j = 1, \cdots, R$ within cluster $i = 1, \cdots, G$, let:
    \begin{align*}
          \log(\mu_i) &\sim N(\alpha + \beta X_i, \gamma^2), \quad \text{where $X_i = 0$ for control and $X_i = 1$ for treatment}, \\
          Y_{ij} \mid \mu_i &\sim \text{Poisson}(\mu_i), \quad \text{for } j = 1, \ldots, R
      \end{align*}

**Estimand:** The primary estimand is the treatment effect, $\beta$,
which quantifies the difference in outcomes between the treatment
($X_i = 1$) and control ($X_i = 0$) groups. For Normal outcomes, $\beta$
represents the average difference in means. For Poisson outcomes,
$\beta$ corresponds to the log-risk ratio of the outcome rates.

**Methods:** 

For each simulation, the generated data set ($X$, $Y$) under normal or Poisson data-generating mechanisms is analyzed using a GLM model, and the estimate $\beta$ is then extracted from the model result.

**Performance Measures:** 

We will assess the performance of the study design using two key metrics: variance and power. Variance measures the variability of $\hat{\beta}$ across simulations, providing insights into how design parameters, such as the number of clusters and measurements per cluster, impact the precision of the treatment effect estimate. Power quantifies the ability to detect significant treatment effects by calculating the proportion of simulations where $\hat{\beta}$ is significantly different from zero. This evaluation focuses on the influence of cost ratios and variability parameters on the statistical power of the study design.

## Varying parameters

The optimization process involved two major steps. First, we fixed the
key parameters of the distribution:
$\alpha=2, \beta=1.5, \sigma^2=1, \gamma^2=1$ These values were chosen
because they represent moderate, plausible magnitudes for intercepts,
effect sizes, and variances in typical clustered designs, allowing us to
explore the study design under realistic and interpretable baseline
conditions. With these baseline values and a fixed budget of 2000, we
systematically varied the relative cost $\frac{c_1}{c_2}$ across 2, 5,
10, and 20, and the number of clusters over a sequence from 10 to 50 in
increments of 5. To compute the cost per observation $c_2$, we used
$c_2 = \frac{c_1}{\text{relative cost}}$. The number of observations per
cluster was then calculated as
$\text{number of Observations per Cluster} = \frac{\text{Budget}-n_{clusters}\cdot c_1}{n_{clusters}\cdot c_2}$.
For example, under a fixed budget of 2000, if the relative cost
$\frac{}{c_1}{c_2}$ is 2 and there are 20 clusters, the number of
observations per cluster would be 98. However, if the relative cost
increases to 10 while keeping the number of clusters at 20, the number
of observations per cluster decreases to 90. This demonstrates that
higher relative cluster costs or an increase in the number of clusters
reduces the number of observations per cluster, as the budget must be
distributed accordingly. The goal of this step was to identify the
optimal combination of the number of clusters and the number of
observations per cluster that minimizes the variance of the estimated
treatment effect $\beta$.

After determining the optimal combination of the number of clusters and
the number of observations per cluster, we fixed these values and
conducted additional simulations to assess how varying the distribution
parameters influences the optimal study design. Specifically, we varied
the residual variance $\sigma^2$ over a sequence from 0.01 to 10 with 10
equally spaced values, and the treatment effect $\beta$ across 0.05,
0.5, and 1.5. Changes in $\sigma^2$ directly affect the intra-class
correlation (ICC), which quantifies the proportion of the total variance
attributable to clustering effects, given by
$\text{ICC} = \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2+\sigma^2}ICC$. Under a fixed
number of clusters and observations per cluster, increasing $\sigma^2$
reduces the ICC, indicating weaker clustering effects. This, in turn,
increases the within-cluster variation relative to the total variation,
which can result in greater variability of the $\beta$ estimate. As
$\sigma^2$ increases, the residual noise dominates, making it harder to
detect the treatment effect precisely and potentially widening
confidence intervals for $\beta$. Conversely, lower values of $\sigma^2$
strengthen clustering effects, reducing the variability of $\beta$ and
improving the precision of the estimate. The parameter $\alpha$,
representing the intercept, was not varied because it does not influence
the variance or clustering structure of the data. Instead, $\alpha$
shifts the overall distribution of outcomes without altering the
relationships between the variables or the precision of the estimates,
and therefore has no direct impact on the performance metrics of the
study design. This step allowed us to evaluate not only the robustness
of the optimal design but also how the degree of residual variance
impacts the precision of $\beta$ under different data generation
conditions. By combining these two steps, we were able to
comprehensively evaluate and refine the study design to achieve a
balance between cost efficiency and statistical precision.

`Table 1` summarizes the variance of the treatment effect estimate ($\hat{\beta}$) and the corresponding number of measurements per cluster ($R$) across various combinations of the number of clusters ($G$) and relative cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$) for both Normal and Poisson data-generating mechanisms. Each row represents a specific number of clusters ($G$), while the columns provide the corresponding $R$ and the variance of $\hat{\beta}$ for cost ratios $c_1/c_2 = 2, 5, 10, 20$, under a fixed budget of 2000. The highlighted cells identify the optimal combinations of $G$ and $R$ that achieve the lowest variance of $\hat{\beta}$, reflecting the most efficient allocation of resources within the given constraints.

### Normal Distribution

Under the Normal distribution, `Figure 1` visualizes the relationship between the variance of the treatment effect estimate ($\hat{\beta}$) and the number of clusters ($G$), stratified by relative cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 2, 5, 10, 20$). Each line represents a specific cost ratio, and the labels indicate the corresponding number of measurements per cluster ($R$) at different cluster sizes. The variance of $\hat{\beta}$ decreases as the number of clusters increases, a trend consistent with the results presented in `Table 1`. However, the decrease follows a pattern of diminishing returns, with minimal reductions in variance observed when the number of clusters exceeds approximately $G = 40$.

`Figure 1` also highlights the trade-offs between within-cluster measurements ($R$) and the number of clusters ($G$) at different cost ratios. For lower cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 2, 5$), more resources are allocated to within-cluster measurements, resulting in steeper reductions in variance at smaller $G$. The optimal configurations in these scenarios, such as $G = 50, R = 3$ for $c_1/c_2 = 2$ and $G = 45, R = 7$ for $c_1/c_2 = 5$, align closely with the results in Table 1, achieving variances of 0.11 and 0.08, respectively. In contrast, higher cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 10, 20$) prioritize increasing the number of clusters, leading to more gradual reductions in variance. Optimal configurations in these cases, such as $G = 45, R = 13$ or $G = 50, R = 11$, yield variances as low as 0.07.

Together, `Figure 1` and `Table 1` demonstrate that while increasing the number of clusters consistently reduces the variance of $\hat{\beta}$, the choice of cost ratio plays a critical role in determining the balance between $G$ and $R$. This relationship underscores the importance of strategic resource allocation to achieve optimal precision under budget constraints in cluster randomized trials.

```

### Poisson

Under the Poisson distribution, the variance of $\beta_{est}$ follows a
similar trend but is generally higher compared to the Normal
distribution, particularly for smaller G. For instance, at G=10 and
$\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=2, the variance is 0.29 under Poisson compared to 0.44
under Normal. This reflects the additional variability associated with
Poisson-distributed outcomes. As G increases, the variance decreases,
and by G=40 or higher, the differences between the two distributions
narrow. Lower cost ratios again lead to smaller variances due to higher
R. The plot for the Poisson distribution confirms these patterns,
showing steeper reductions in variance at smaller G values and
stabilization as G increases.

# Assign colors for the c1/c2 ratio

  "2" = brewer.pal(9, "Blues")[5],  # Moderate orange

)

            position = position_nudge(y = 0.025, x=2.2),  # Nudging text upward
            size = 2, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_color_manual(values = colors_poisson, name = "Relative costs (c1/c2)") +
  facet_wrap(~c1_c2_ratio, nrow = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 2: Variance of Beta Estimates vs. Number of Clusters",
    x = "Number of Clusters",
    y = "Variance of Beta Estimates"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, face = "bold"),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8),
    legend.position = "bottom"
  )
```

In summary, the results demonstrate that increasing G reduces the
variance of $\beta_{est}$ under both distributions, with more pronounced
improvements at smaller G values. Higher cost ratios
($\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=10 or 20) result in higher variances due to fewer
observations per cluster. The variance is consistently higher for the
Poisson distribution at smaller G, but this difference diminishes as G
increases, reflecting the stabilizing effect of larger sample sizes.
These findings highlight the importance of optimizing the number of
clusters, observations per cluster, and cost ratios to ensure precise
and efficient study designs under varying distributions.

This table summarizes simulation results for the Normal and Poisson
distributions under varying cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$), variances
($\sigma^2$ and $\gamma^2$), and treatment effect sizes ($\beta$). As
the cost ratio increases, the number of clusters ($G$) decreases, and
the number of observations per cluster ($R$) increases, reflecting the
allocation of resources between clusters and individuals. For the Normal
distribution, the variability of the beta estimate
($\text{Var}(\beta_{\text{est}})$) remains relatively stable, and power
is generally higher, especially at lower variances ($\sigma^2 = 0.1$).
In contrast, the Poisson distribution shows higher variability in beta
estimates and lower power overall, particularly at larger variances
($\sigma^2 = 10$).

Increasing variance ($\sigma^2$) negatively impacts both distributions
by increasing $\text{Var}(\beta_{\text{est}})$ and reducing power.
However, the Poisson distribution is more sensitive to variance, leading
to significant reductions in power for smaller treatment effects
($\beta = 0.05$). Larger treatment effects ($\beta = 1.50$) consistently
improve power and reduce variability across both distributions, though
the Normal distribution outperforms Poisson in terms of stability and
power.

The balance between clusters and observations is crucial. For the Normal
distribution, increasing the cost ratio ($c_1/c_2$) and allocating more
observations per cluster tends to improve power and stabilize
$\text{Var}(\beta_{\text{est}})$. Conversely, for the Poisson
distribution, increasing the number of clusters ($G$) by reducing the
cost ratio might help mitigate the higher variability observed with
larger variances. This highlights the importance of careful design
considerations in resource allocation, especially when dealing with high
variance or smaller treatment effects. Overall, the Normal distribution
demonstrates better performance in terms of lower variability and higher
power, making it a preferable choice when its assumptions are met.

### Normal

This plot illustrates the impact of residual variance ($\sigma^2$) on
the variance of $\beta_{est}$ and power under the Normal distribution,
stratified by three treatment effect sizes ($\beta$ =0.05,0.5,1.5) and
four relative cost ratios ($\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=2,5,10,20). In the left
panel, the variance of $\beta_{est}$ increases as $\sigma^2$ grows,
particularly beyond $\sigma^2$=5. This trend reflects the additional
variability introduced by larger residuals, which reduces the precision
of the $\beta$ estimate. Lower cost ratios ($\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=2) exhibit
slightly higher variances for smaller $\sigma^2$, while higher cost
ratios ($\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=10 or 20) stabilize the variance as $\sigma^2$
increases by spreading the variability across more clusters. Larger
treatment effects ($\beta$=1.5) consistently result in lower variances
compared to smaller treatment effects ($\beta$=0.05), demonstrating that
larger effect sizes are easier to estimate precisely, even in the
presence of variability.

In the right panel, power decreases with increasing $\sigma^2$,
particularly for smaller treatment effects ($\beta$=0.05), where
detecting the effect becomes increasingly challenging as residual
variability grows. Lower cost ratios ($\frac{c_1}{c_2}$ =2) achieve
slightly higher power for small $\sigma^2$, as they allocate more
resources to within-cluster observations, improving the ability to
detect effects. In contrast, higher cost ratios ( $\frac{c_1}{c_2}$=10
or 20) prioritize increasing the number of clusters, which can reduce
power due to fewer observations per cluster. For large treatment effects
($\beta$=1.5), power is relatively robust to changes in $\sigma^2$ and
cost ratios, reflecting the strong signal associated with larger
effects. These results highlight the trade-offs between cost allocation,
residual variability, and treatment effect size in study design, with
smaller treatment effects being more sensitive to increased variability
and cost distribution strategies.

### Poisson

This plot examines the variance of $\beta_{\text{est}}$ (left panel) and
power (right panel) as functions of $\gamma^2$ under the Poisson
distribution, stratified by treatment effect sizes
($\beta = 0.5, 1.5, 3$) and relative cost ratios
($c_1/c_2 = 2, 5, 10, 20$). The variance of $\beta_{\text{est}}$
increases consistently with $\gamma^2$ across all treatment effect sizes
and cost ratios. Higher $\gamma^2$, representing greater between-cluster
variability, adds uncertainty to $\beta_{\text{est}}$, with the most
pronounced increases observed beyond $\gamma^2 = 5$. Lower cost ratios
($c_1/c_2 = 2$) result in slightly higher variances due to a larger
number of within-cluster observations, amplifying the effects of
between-cluster heterogeneity. Higher cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 10$ or
20), which prioritize more clusters, mitigate this effect by
distributing variability across more clusters. Larger treatment effects
($\beta = 3$) generally show higher variances compared to smaller
effects, as larger effects are more influenced by between-cluster
heterogeneity.

The power to detect treatment effects decreases as $\gamma^2$ increases,
particularly for smaller treatment effects ($\beta = 0.5$). Power is
highest for smaller $\gamma^2$ values and larger treatment effects
($\beta = 3$), which are less sensitive to increases in between-cluster
heterogeneity. Lower cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 2$) achieve slightly higher
power for smaller $\gamma^2$ because they allocate more observations per
cluster, improving the ability to detect small effects. Conversely,
higher cost ratios ($c_1/c_2 = 10$ or 20) lead to lower power for small
treatment effects as $\gamma^2$ grows, due to fewer within-cluster
observations. These results highlight the trade-off between cost

### Comparison

The effects of increasing $\sigma^2$ in the Normal distribution and
$\gamma^2$ in the Poisson distribution on the variance of
$\beta_{\text{est}}$ share several similarities but operate through
distinct mechanisms. In both cases, increasing these parameters leads to
higher variance of $\beta_{\text{est}}$, as they represent measures of
variability in the data. The impact of both parameters becomes more
pronounced as their values grow, with steeper increases in variance
observed at higher levels of $\sigma^2$ and $\gamma^2$. Additionally,
the effects of both parameters are influenced by study design features,
such as the number of clusters and the allocation of observations per
cluster, which can mitigate their impact.

However, key differences exist between the two. In the Normal
distribution, $\sigma^2$ represents residual variability at the
individual level, affecting precision by amplifying within-cluster
noise. In contrast, $\gamma^2$ in the Poisson distribution captures
between-cluster variability in log-scale means, influencing the
heterogeneity of cluster-specific rates and indirectly affecting
within-cluster variation. The effect of $\sigma^2$ is more sensitive to
the number of observations per cluster ($R$), as larger within-cluster
samples reduce residual noise. In contrast, $\gamma^2$ primarily depends
on the number of clusters ($G$), as adding clusters distributes
variability across a larger sample. Moreover, $\sigma^2$ operates
directly on the outcome’s original scale, while $\gamma^2$ acts on the
log-scale, amplifying differences between cluster-level means. These
distinctions highlight how variability parameters uniquely influence the
precision of $\beta_{\text{est}}$ depending on the distributional
assumptions and emphasize the importance of tailored strategies for
study design optimization.

# Discussion
This study provides insights into optimizing the design of cluster randomized trials under budgetary constraints, focusing on minimizing the variance of treatment effect estimates ($\hat{\beta}$) while balancing trade-offs between within-cluster and between-cluster variability. By systematically varying the number of clusters ($G$), measurements per cluster ($R$), cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$), and variance components ($\sigma^2$, $\gamma^2$), we identified optimal configurations that maximize statistical precision. Our findings highlight the critical role of cost ratios in determining resource allocation strategies. Lower cost ratios prioritize within-cluster measurements, leading to steeper reductions in variance at smaller cluster sizes, while higher cost ratios favor increasing the number of clusters to achieve lower variance.

The results also emphasize the importance of distributional assumptions in trial design. For Normal outcomes, increasing residual variance ($\sigma^2$) weakens clustering effects, increasing the variability of $\hat{\beta}$ and reducing precision. Conversely, for Poisson outcomes, between-cluster variability ($\gamma^2$) influences both variance and power, with greater sensitivity to clustering heterogeneity compared to Normal outcomes. These differences underscore the need to account for distribution-specific characteristics when designing cluster randomized trials.

Despite its contributions, this study has limitations. The simulation scenarios were restricted to 100 iterations per parameter configuration, which may not fully capture the variability in estimates. Additionally, the sequential approach of optimizing $G$ and $R$ before varying variance components and treatment effects does not allow for joint optimization, potentially overlooking interactions between these parameters. Finally, while the intra-class correlation (ICC) was explored by varying $\sigma^2$ for Normal outcomes, $\gamma^2$ was not varied simultaneously, limiting insights into the differential impacts of these components. Future work should address these limitations by increasing the number of simulations, varying all parameters simultaneously, and exploring broader distributional assumptions to enhance the generalizability of the findings. These advancements will provide more comprehensive guidance for designing cost-efficient and statistically robust cluster randomized trials.



# Limitation

This project has several limitations. First, the number of simulations conducted for each scenario was limited to 100 due to computational constraints. While this choice was made to balance running time and feasibility, it may not fully capture the variability in the estimates, potentially leading to less stable conclusions about the optimal combinations of clusters ($G$) and measurements per cluster ($R$). Increasing the number of simulations would provide more robust and reliable results, albeit at the cost of significantly greater computational resources.

Second, the sequential approach used to determine the optimal design parameters introduces a limitation. The number of clusters ($G$) and relative cost ratios ($c_1/c_2$) were varied first to identify the optimal combination of $G$ and $R$, and then the variance components ($\sigma^2$, $\gamma^2$) and treatment effects ($\beta$) were varied while keeping the optimal $G$ and $R$ fixed. This approach does not allow for the simultaneous variation of $G$, $R$, variance components, and treatment effects. As a result, potential interactions between these parameters could not be fully explored, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future work should consider varying all parameters together to better capture their joint effects on study outcomes.

Finally, the exploration of intra-class correlation (ICC) under the Normal distribution focused on varying $\sigma^2$ while keeping other parameters fixed. Although this approach provided insights into how ICC impacts the variance of $\hat{\beta}$, $\gamma^2$ was not varied. Both $\sigma^2$ and $\gamma^2$ contribute to ICC, but their individual impacts on the variance of $\hat{\beta}$ may differ. By not varying $\gamma^2$, the analysis may overlook important differences in how these parameters affect ICC and the resulting variance of $\hat{\beta}$. Future studies should address this by simultaneously varying $\sigma^2$ and $\gamma^2$ to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their respective roles in influencing ICC and study precision.
